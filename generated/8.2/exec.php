/**
 * proc_open is similar to popen
 * but provides a much greater degree of control over the program execution.
 *
 * @param string $command The commandline to execute as string. Special characters have to be properly escaped,
 * and proper quoting has to be applied.
 *
 * As of PHP 7.4.0, command may be passed as array of command parameters.
 * In this case the process will be opened directly (without going through a shell)
 * and PHP will take care of any necessary argument escaping.
 *
 * On Windows, the argument escaping of the array elements assumes that the
 * command line parsing of the executed command is compatible with the parsing
 * of command line arguments done by the VC runtime.
 * @param array $descriptor_spec An indexed array where the key represents the descriptor number and the
 * value represents how PHP will pass that descriptor to the child
 * process. 0 is stdin, 1 is stdout, while 2 is stderr.
 *
 * Each element can be:
 *
 * An array describing the pipe to pass to the process. The first
 * element is the descriptor type and the second element is an option for
 * the given type. Valid types are pipe (the second
 * element is either r to pass the read end of the pipe
 * to the process, or w to pass the write end) and
 * file (the second element is a filename).
 * Note that anything else than w is treated like r.
 *
 *
 * A stream resource representing a real file descriptor (e.g. opened file,
 * a socket, STDIN).
 *
 *
 *
 * The file descriptor numbers are not limited to 0, 1 and 2 - you may
 * specify any valid file descriptor number and it will be passed to the
 * child process. This allows your script to interoperate with other
 * scripts that run as "co-processes". In particular, this is useful for
 * passing passphrases to programs like PGP, GPG and openssl in a more
 * secure manner. It is also useful for reading status information
 * provided by those programs on auxiliary file descriptors.
 * @param resource[]|null $pipes Will be set to an indexed array of file pointers that correspond to
 * PHP's end of any pipes that are created.
 * @param string|null $cwd The initial working dir for the command. This must be an
 * absolute directory path, or NULL
 * if you want to use the default value (the working dir of the current
 * PHP process)
 * @param array|null $env_vars An array with the environment variables for the command that will be
 * run, or NULL to use the same environment as the current PHP process
 * @param array $options Allows you to specify additional options. Currently supported options
 * include:
 *
 *
 * suppress_errors (windows only): suppresses errors
 * generated by this function when it's set to TRUE
 *
 *
 * bypass_shell (windows only): bypass
 * cmd.exe shell when set to TRUE
 *
 *
 * blocking_pipes (windows only): force
 * blocking pipes when set to TRUE
 *
 *
 * create_process_group (windows only): allow the
 * child process to handle CTRL events when set to TRUE
 *
 *
 * create_new_console (windows only): the new process
 * has a new console, instead of inheriting its parent's console
 *
 *
 * @return resource Returns a resource representing the process, which should be freed using
 * proc_close when you are finished with it. On failure
 * returns FALSE.
 * @throws ExecException
