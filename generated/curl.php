 * what methods it supports and pick the best one.
 * 
 * 
 * CURLAUTH_ANY is an alias for
 * CURLAUTH_BASIC | CURLAUTH_DIGEST | CURLAUTH_GSSNEGOTIATE | CURLAUTH_NTLM.

 * 
 *

 * 
 * 
 * CURLOPT_INFILESIZE

 * CURLOPT_CLOSEPOLICY is used to determine
 * which connection to close.
 *

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS

 * CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS
 * 
 * Bitmask of CURLPROTO_* values. If used, this bitmask
 * limits what protocols libcurl may use in a transfer that it follows to in
 * a redirect when CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION is enabled.
 * This allows you to limit specific transfers to only be allowed to use a subset
 * of protocols in redirections. By default libcurl will allow all protocols
 * except for FILE and SCP. This is a difference compared to pre-7.19.4 versions
 * which unconditionally would follow to all protocols supported.

 * CURLAUTH_BASIC,
 * CURLAUTH_GSSAPI,

 * what methods it supports and pick the best one.
 * 
 * 
 * CURLAUTH_BASIC allows username/password authentication.
 * 
 * 
 * CURLAUTH_GSSAPI allows GSS-API authentication.

 * CURL_SSLVERSION_TLSv1_1 (5) or
 * CURL_SSLVERSION_TLSv1_2 (6).
 * The maximum TLS version can be set by using one of the CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_*
 * constants. It is also possible to OR one of the CURL_SSLVERSION_*
 * constants with one of the CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_* constants.
 * CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_DEFAULT (the maximum version supported by the library),
 * CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_TLSv1_0,
 * CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_TLSv1_1,

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_VERIFYHOST

 * When set to 0 the connection succeeds regardless of the names used in the certificate. 
 * Use that ability with caution! 
 * 1 treated as a debug option in curl 7.28.0 and earlier. 
 * From curl 7.28.1 to 7.65.3 CURLE_BAD_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT is returned.
 * From curl 7.66.0 onwards 1 and 2 is treated as the same value.

 * 
 * If set to 1, TCP keepalive probes will be sent. The delay and
 * frequency of these probes can be controlled by the CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE
 * and CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL options, provided the operating system
 * supports them. If set to 0 (default) keepalive probes are disabled.
 * 
 * 
 * Added in cURL 7.25.0. Available since PHP 5.5.0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE

 * 
 * 
 *

 * 
 * The time in seconds since January 1st, 1970. The time will be used
 * by CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION. Defaults to zero.

 * CURLOPT_INFILE
 * 
 * The file that the transfer should be read from when uploading.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CURLOPT_STDERR
 * 
 * An alternative location to output errors to instead of
 * STDERR.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER
 * 
 * The file that the header part of the transfer is written to.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * value should be the name of a valid function or a Closure 
 * for the following values of the option parameter:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Option
 * Set value to
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION
 * 
 * A callback accepting two parameters.
 * The first is the cURL resource, the second is a
 * string with the header data to be written. The header data must
 * be written by this callback. Return the number of 
 * bytes written.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CURLOPT_PASSWDFUNCTION
 * 
 * A callback accepting three parameters. 
 * The first is the cURL resource, the second is a
 * string containing a password prompt, and the third is the maximum
 * password length. Return the string containing the password.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION
 * 
 * 
 * A callback accepting five parameters.
 * The first is the cURL resource, the second is the total number of
 * bytes expected to be downloaded in this transfer, the third is
 * the number of bytes downloaded so far, the fourth is the total
 * number of bytes expected to be uploaded in this transfer, and the
 * fifth is the number of bytes uploaded so far.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The callback is only called when the CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS
 * option is set to FALSE.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Return a non-zero value to abort the transfer. In which case, the
 * transfer will set a CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK
 * error.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CURLOPT_READFUNCTION
 * 
 * A callback accepting three parameters. 
 * The first is the cURL resource, the second is a
 * stream resource provided to cURL through the option
 * CURLOPT_INFILE, and the third is the maximum
 * amount of data to be read. The callback must return a string
 * with a length equal or smaller than the amount of data requested,
 * typically by reading it from the passed stream resource. It should
 * return an empty string to signal EOF.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION
 * 
 * A callback accepting two parameters. 
 * The first is the cURL resource, and the second is a
 * string with the data to be written. The data must be saved by
 * this callback. It must return the exact number of bytes written 
 * or the transfer will be aborted with an error.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * A callback accepting five parameters.
 * The first is the cURL resource, the second is the total number of

 * the number of bytes downloaded so far, the fourth is the total
 * number of bytes expected to be uploaded in this transfer, and the
 * fifth is the number of bytes uploaded so far.
 * 
 * The callback is only called when the CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS
 * option is set to FALSE.
 * 
 * Return a non-zero value to abort the transfer. In which case, the
 * transfer will set a CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK
 * error.
