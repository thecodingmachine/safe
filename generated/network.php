/**
 * Fetch DNS Resource Records associated with the given
 * hostname.
 * 
 * @param string $hostname hostname should be a valid DNS hostname such
 * as "www.example.com". Reverse lookups can be generated
 * using in-addr.arpa notation, but
 * gethostbyaddr is more suitable for
 * the majority of reverse lookups.
 * 
 * Per DNS standards, email addresses are given in user.host format (for
 * example: hostmaster.example.com as opposed to hostmaster@example.com),
 * be sure to check this value and modify if necessary before using it
 * with a functions such as mail.
 * @param int $type By default, dns_get_record will search for any
 * resource records associated with hostname. 
 * To limit the query, specify the optional type
 * parameter. May be any one of the following:
 * DNS_A, DNS_CNAME,
 * DNS_HINFO, DNS_CAA,
 * DNS_MX, DNS_NS,
 * DNS_PTR, DNS_SOA,
 * DNS_TXT, DNS_AAAA,
 * DNS_SRV, DNS_NAPTR,
 * DNS_A6, DNS_ALL
 * or DNS_ANY.
 * 
 * Because of eccentricities in the performance of libresolv
 * between platforms, DNS_ANY will not
 * always return every record, the slower DNS_ALL
 * will collect all records more reliably.
 * 
 * DNS_CAA is not supported on Windows.
 * @param array|null $authns Passed by reference and, if given, will be populated with Resource
 * Records for the Authoritative Name Servers.
 * @param array|null $addtl Passed by reference and, if given, will be populated with any
 * Additional Records.
 * @param bool $raw The type will be interpreted as a raw DNS type ID
 * (the DNS_* constants cannot be used).
 * The return value will contain a data key, which needs
 * to be manually parsed.
 * @return array This function returns an array of associative arrays. Each associative array contains
 * at minimum the following keys:
 * 
 * Basic DNS attributes
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Attribute
 * Meaning
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * host
 * 
 * The record in the DNS namespace to which the rest of the associated data refers.

 * class
 * 
 * dns_get_record only returns Internet class records and as
 * such this parameter will always return IN.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * type

 * in the resulting array dependant on the value of type. See table below.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ttl
 * 
 * "Time To Live" remaining for this record. This will not equal
 * the record's original ttl, but will rather equal the original ttl minus whatever
 * length of time has passed since the authoritative name server was queried.
 * 
 *

 * with either ssl:// or tls:// to
 * use an SSL or TLS client connection over TCP/IP to connect to the

 * -1 for transports that do not use ports, such as
 * unix://.
 * @param int|null $errno If provided, holds the system level error number that occurred in the
 * system-level connect() call.
 * 
 * If the value returned in errno is
 * 0 and the function returned FALSE, it is an
 * indication that the error occurred before the

 * problem initializing the socket.
