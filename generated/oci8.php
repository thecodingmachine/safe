/**
 * Binds a PHP variable variable to the Oracle
 * bind variable placeholder bv_name.  Binding
 * is important for Oracle database performance and also as a way to
 * avoid SQL Injection security issues.
 * 
 * Binding allows the database to reuse the statement context and
 * caches from previous executions of the statement, even if another
 * user or process originally executed it.  Binding reduces SQL
 * Injection concerns because the data associated with a bind
 * variable is never treated as part of the SQL statement.  It does
 * not need quoting or escaping.
 * 
 * PHP variables that have been bound can be changed and the
 * statement re-executed without needing to re-parse the statement or
 * re-bind.
 * 
 * In Oracle, bind variables are commonly divided
 * into IN binds for values that are passed into
 * the database, and OUT binds for values that are
 * returned to PHP.  A bind variable may be
 * both IN and OUT.  Whether a
 * bind variable will be used for input or output is determined at
 * run-time.
 * 
 * You must specify maxlength when using
 * an OUT bind so that PHP allocates enough memory
 * to hold the returned value.
 * 
 * For IN binds it is recommended to set
 * the maxlength length if the statement is
 * re-executed multiple times with different values for the PHP
 * variable.  Otherwise Oracle may truncate data to the length of the
 * initial PHP variable value.  If you don't know what the maximum
 * length will be, then re-call oci_bind_by_name
 * with the current data size prior to
 * each oci_execute call. Binding an
 * unnecessarily large length will have an impact on process memory
 * in the database.
 * 
 * A bind call tells Oracle which memory address to read data from.
 * For IN binds that address needs to contain
 * valid data when oci_execute is called.  This
 * means that the variable bound must remain in scope until
 * execution.  If it doesn't, unexpected results or errors such as
 * "ORA-01460: unimplemented or unreasonable conversion requested"
 * may occur.  For OUT binds one symptom is no
 * value being set in the PHP variable.
 * 
 * For a statement that is repeatedly executed, binding values that
 * never change may reduce the ability of the Oracle optimizer to
 * choose the best statement execution plan.  Long running statements
 * that are rarely re-executed may not benefit from binding.  However
 * in both cases, binding might be safer than joining strings into a
 * SQL statement, as this can be a security risk if unfiltered user
 * text is concatenated.
 * 
 * @param resource $statement A valid OCI8 statement identifer.
 * @param string $bv_name The colon-prefixed bind variable placeholder used in the
 * statement.  The colon is optional
 * in bv_name. Oracle does not use question
 * marks for placeholders.
 * @param mixed $variable The PHP variable to be associated with bv_name
 * @param int $maxlength Sets the maximum length for the data. If you set it to -1, this
 * function will use the current length
 * of variable to set the maximum
 * length. In this case the variable must
 * exist and contain data
 * when oci_bind_by_name is called.
 * @param int $type The datatype that Oracle will treat the data as.  The
 * default type used
 * is SQLT_CHR. Oracle will convert the data
 * between this type and the database column (or PL/SQL variable
 * type), when possible.
 * 
 * If you need to bind an abstract datatype (LOB/ROWID/BFILE) you
 * need to allocate it first using the
 * oci_new_descriptor function. The
 * length is not used for abstract datatypes
 * and should be set to -1.
 * 
 * Possible values for type are:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * SQLT_BFILEE or OCI_B_BFILE

 * 
 * @param string $username The Oracle user name.

 * the Oracle instance to connect to. It can be
 * an Easy Connect
 * string, or a Connect Name from
 * the tnsnames.ora file, or the name of a local
 * Oracle instance.
 * 
 * If not specified, PHP uses
 * environment variables such as TWO_TASK (on Linux)
 * or LOCAL (on Windows)
 * and ORACLE_SID to determine the
 * Oracle instance to connect to.
 * 
 * 
 * To use the Easy Connect naming method, PHP must be linked with Oracle
 * 10g or greater Client libraries. The Easy Connect string for Oracle
 * 10g is of the form:
 * [//]host_name[:port][/service_name]. From Oracle
 * 11g, the syntax is:
 * [//]host_name[:port][/service_name][:server_type][/instance_name].
 * Futher options were introduced with Oracle 19c, including timeout and keep-alive
 * settings.  Refer to Oracle documentation.  Service names can be found by running
 * the Oracle utility lsnrctl status on the database server
 * machine.
 * 
 * 
 * The tnsnames.ora file can be in the Oracle Net search path,
 * which
 * includes /your/path/to/instantclient/network/admin, $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin
 * and /etc.  Alternatively set TNS_ADMIN
 * so that $TNS_ADMIN/tnsnames.ora is read.  Make sure the web
 * daemon has read access to the file.
 * @param string $character_set Determines
 * the character set used by the Oracle Client libraries.  The character
 * set does not need to match the character set used by the database.  If
 * it doesn't match, Oracle will do its best to convert data to and from
 * the database character set.  Depending on the character sets this may
 * not give usable results.  Conversion also adds some time overhead.
 * 
 * If not specified, the
 * Oracle Client libraries determine a character set from
 * the NLS_LANG environment variable.
 * 
 * Passing this parameter can
 * reduce the time taken to connect.
 * @param int $session_mode This
 * parameter is available since version PHP 5 (PECL OCI8 1.1) and accepts the
 * following values: OCI_DEFAULT,
 * OCI_SYSOPER and OCI_SYSDBA.

 * OCI_CRED_EXT mode value. This tells Oracle to use
 * External or OS authentication, which must be configured in the
 * database.  The OCI_CRED_EXT flag can only be used
 * with username of "/" and a empty password.
 * oci8.privileged_connect
 * may be On or Off.
 * 
 * 
 * OCI_CRED_EXT may be combined with the
 * OCI_SYSOPER or

 * 
 * If not specified, PHP uses

 * the database character set.  Depending on the character sets this may
 * not give usable results.  Conversion also adds some time overhead.
 * 
 * If not specified, the
 * Oracle Client libraries determine a character set from
 * the NLS_LANG environment variable.
 *

/**
 * Sets the number of rows to be buffered by the Oracle Client

 * increasing the prefetch count above the
 * default oci8.default_prefetch
 * value.
 * 
 * Prefetching is Oracle's efficient way of returning more than one
 * data row from the database in each network request.  This can
 * result in better network and CPU utilization.  The buffering of
 * rows is internal to OCI8 and the behavior of OCI8 fetching
 * functions is unchanged regardless of the prefetch count. For
 * example, oci_fetch_row will always return one
 * row.  The prefetch buffer is per-statement and is not used by
 * re-executed statements or by other connections.
 * 
 * Call oci_set_prefetch before
 * calling oci_execute.
 * 
 * A tuning goal is to set the prefetch value to a reasonable size for
 * the network and database to handle.  For queries returning a very
 * large number of rows, overall system efficiency might be better if
 * rows are retrieved from the database in several chunks (i.e set the
 * prefetch value smaller than the number of rows).  This allows the
 * database to handle other users' statements while the PHP script is
 * processing the current set of rows.
 * 
 * Query prefetching was introduced in Oracle 8i.  REF CURSOR
 * prefetching was introduced in Oracle 11gR2 and occurs when PHP is
 * linked with Oracle 11gR2 (or later) Client libraries.
 * Nested cursor prefetching was
 * introduced in Oracle 11gR2 and requires both the Oracle Client
 * libraries and the database to be version 11gR2 or greater.
 * 
 * Prefetching is not supported when queries contain LONG or LOB
 * columns.  The prefetch value is ignored and single-row fetches will
 * be used in all the situations when prefetching is not supported.
 * 
 * When using Oracle Database 12c, the prefetch
 * value set by PHP can be overridden by Oracle's
 * client oraaccess.xml configuration file.  Refer
 * to Oracle documentation for more detail.
 *
